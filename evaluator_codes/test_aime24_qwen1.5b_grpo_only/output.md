## Test 1

### Question
Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### Answer 1:

To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into exponential form.

The given equations are:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

First, we convert each logarithmic equation to its exponential form:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we express each equation in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Now, we multiply these three equations together:
\[
x \cdot y \cdot z = (yz \sqrt{2}) \cdot (xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}) \cdot (xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}})
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
x \cdot y \cdot z = yz \cdot xz \cdot xy \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
x \cdot y \cdot z = (xyz)^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}}\), we have:
\[
x \cdot y \cdot z = (xyz)^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Combine the exponents of 2:
\[
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

Find a common denominator for the exponents:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]

Add the fractions:
\[
\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus:
\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

So, the equation becomes:
\[
x \cdot y \cdot z = (xyz)^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Let \(k = xyz\). Then:
\[
k = k^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Divide both sides by \(k\):
\[
1 = k \cdot 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Solve for \(k\):
\[
k = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(x^4) + \log_2(y^3) + \log_2(z^2)
\]
\[
= 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

Express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(k\):
\[
\log_2(x) = \log_2\left(\frac{k}{yz}\right) = \log_2\left(\frac{k}{\frac{k^2}{x}}\right) = \log_2\left(\frac{x^2}{k}\right) = 2 \log_2(x) - \log_2(k)
\]
\[
\log_2(y) = \log_2\left(\frac{k}{xz}\right) = \log_2\left(\frac{k}{\frac{k^2}{y}}\right) = \log_2\left(\frac{y^2}{k}\right) = 2 \log_2(y) - \log_2(k)
\]
\[
\log_2(z) = \log_2\left(\frac{k}{xy}\right) = \log_2\left(\frac{k}{\frac{k^2}{z}}\right) = \log_2\left(\frac{z^2}{k}\right) = 2 \log_2(z) - \log_2(k)
\]

Substitute back:
\[
4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) = 4 \left(\frac{\log_2(k)}{2}\right) + 3 \left(\frac{\log_2(k)}{2}\right) + 2 \left(\frac{\log_2(k)}{2}\right)
\]
\[
= 2 \log_2(k) + \frac{3}{2} \log_2(k) + \log_2(k)
\]
\[
= \frac{7}{2} \log_2(k)
\]

Since \(k = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}\):
\[
\log_2(k) = \log_2\left(2^{-\frac{13}{12}}\right) = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{7}{2} \log_2(k) = \frac{7}{2} \left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) = -\frac{91}{24}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \left|-\frac{91}{24}\right| = \frac{91}{24}
\]

Finally, the value of \(m+n\) is:
\[
m = 91, \quad n = 24
\]
\[
m + n = 91 + 24 = 115
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{115}
\]

### Answer 2:

To solve the given system of equations involving logarithms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the logarithmic equations to their exponential forms.
2. Solve the resulting system of equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
3. Substitute the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) into the expression \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\).
4. Simplify the expression to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) and then find \(m+n\).

First, let's rewrite the given equations in their exponential forms:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \implies \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

From these equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:
\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz
\]
\[
y = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot xz
\]
\[
z = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} \cdot xy
\]

To find a common solution, we can use the product of these three equations:
\[
(xyz) = \left(\sqrt{2} \cdot yz\right) \left(2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot xz\right) \left(2^{\frac{1}{4}} \cdot xy\right)
\]
\[
xyz = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} \cdot (xyz)^2
\]
\[
xyz = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} \cdot (xyz)^2
\]
\[
xyz = 2^{\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right)} \cdot (xyz)^2
\]
\[
xyz = 2^{\left(\frac{6 + 4 + 3}{12}\right)} \cdot (xyz)^2
\]
\[
xyz = 2^{\frac{13}{12}} \cdot (xyz)^2
\]
\[
1 = 2^{\frac{13}{12}} \cdot xyz
\]
\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now we can substitute \(xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}\) into the original equations to find \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{-\frac{13}{12}} / x \implies x^2 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{-\frac{13}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{-\frac{13}{12}} = 2^{-\frac{7}{12}}
\]
\[
x = 2^{-\frac{7}{24}}
\]
Similarly, we can find:
\[
y = 2^{-\frac{7}{24}}
\]
\[
z = 2^{-\frac{7}{24}}
\]

Now we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\):
\[
x^4y^3z^2 = \left(2^{-\frac{7}{24}}\right)^4 \left(2^{-\frac{7}{24}}\right)^3 \left(2^{-\frac{7}{24}}\right)^2 = 2^{-\frac{28}{24}} \cdot 2^{-\frac{21}{24}} \cdot 2^{-\frac{14}{24}} = 2^{-\left(\frac{28 + 21 + 14}{24}\right)} = 2^{-\frac{63}{24}} = 2^{-\frac{21}{8}}
\]
\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = \log_2\left(2^{-\frac{21}{8}}\right) = -\frac{21}{8}
\]
\[
\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \left|-\frac{21}{8}\right| = \frac{21}{8}
\]
Thus, \(m = 21\) and \(n = 8\), so \(m + n = 21 + 8 = 29\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]

### Answer 3:

To solve this problem, we need to first translate the given logarithmic equations into algebraic equations. Let's start with the given system of equations:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite these equations as:

\[
\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2(y) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(z) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2(z) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(y) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let's denote \(\log_2(x) = a\), \(\log_2(y) = b\), and \(\log_2(z) = c\). Then the equations become:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, add all three equations:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0 = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

So we get:

\[
0 = \frac{13}{12}
\]

This is incorrect, indicating that the sum of the equations is not giving us new information directly. Instead, let's solve the system by isolating variables. From the first equation:

\[
a = b + c + \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substitute this into the second equation:

\[
b - (b + c + \frac{1}{2}) - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
b - b - c - \frac{1}{2} - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
-2c - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
-2c = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
-2c = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{3}{6}
\]
\[
-2c = \frac{5}{6}
\]
\[
c = -\frac{5}{12}
\]

Now substitute \(c\) back into the equation for \(a\):

\[
a = b - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
a = b - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{6}{12}
\]
\[
a = b + \frac{1}{12}
\]

Now we substitute \(a\) and \(c\) into the third equation:

\[
-\frac{5}{12} - (b + \frac{1}{12} + b) = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-\frac{5}{12} - 2b - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-\frac{6}{12} - 2b = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-\frac{1}{2} - 2b = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-2b = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
-2b = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4}
\]
\[
-2b = \frac{3}{4}
\]
\[
b = -\frac{3}{8}
\]

Now we can find \(a\):

\[
a = -\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{12}
\]
\[
a = -\frac{9}{24} + \frac{2}{24}
\]
\[
a = -\frac{7}{24}
\]

So we have:

\[
\log_2(x) = -\frac{7}{24}, \quad \log_2(y) = -\frac{3}{8}, \quad \log_2(z) = -\frac{5}{12}
\]

We need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z)
\]
\[
= 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right)
\]
\[
= -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{10}{12}
\]
\[
= -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}
\]
\[
= -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{5}{6} - \frac{9}{8}
\]
\[
= -\frac{12}{6} - \frac{9}{8}
\]
\[
= -2 - \frac{9}{8}
\]
\[
= -\frac{16}{8} - \frac{9}{8}
\]
\[
= -\frac{25}{8}
\]

So:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \left|-\frac{25}{8}\right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{25}{8}\), and the sum \(m+n\) is \(25+8 = 33\).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{33}
\]

## Test 2

### Question
Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### Answer 1:

To find the side length of the hexagon \(ABCDEF\), we start by noting that it is an equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. This implies that the hexagon can be divided into smaller equilateral triangles. Let the side length of the hexagon be \(s\).

When the extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are considered, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is called the "outer triangle" of the hexagon. The key insight is that the outer triangle is similar to the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon, which is an equilateral triangle with side length equal to \(s\).

The relationship between the outer triangle and the inner triangle is given by the ratio of the side lengths of the outer triangle to the inner triangle. The inner triangle is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon, and its side length is \(s\). The outer triangle is formed by extending the sides of the hexagon, and its side lengths are 200, 240, and 300.

The ratio of the side lengths of the outer triangle to the inner triangle is the same as the ratio of the longest side of the outer triangle to the longest side of the inner triangle. The longest side of the outer triangle is 300, and the longest side of the inner triangle is \(s\). Therefore, the ratio is:

\[
\frac{300}{s} = \frac{300}{2s} = \frac{300}{2.4s} = \frac{300}{2.5s}
\]

Since the ratio of the side lengths of the outer triangle to the inner triangle is the same for all sides, we can use the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the side lengths of the outer triangle is equal to the reciprocal of the side length of the inner triangle:

\[
\frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{240} + \frac{1}{300} = \frac{1}{s}
\]

To find a common denominator, we calculate the least common multiple of 200, 240, and 300, which is 1200. Then we rewrite the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{200} = \frac{6}{1200}, \quad \frac{1}{240} = \frac{5}{1200}, \quad \frac{1}{300} = \frac{4}{1200}
\]

Adding these fractions together, we get:

\[
\frac{6}{1200} + \frac{5}{1200} + \frac{4}{1200} = \frac{15}{1200} = \frac{1}{80}
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{s} = \frac{1}{80} \implies s = 80
\]

Thus, the side length of the hexagon is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]

### Answer 2:

To find the side length of the hexagon \(ABCDEF\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the hexagon. Since \(ABCDEF\) is an equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it can be divided into two congruent parallelograms by drawing the diagonals \(AD\) and \(CF\). Let the side length of the hexagon be \(s\).

When we extend the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\), we form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is known as the "outer triangle" of the hexagon. The outer triangle is formed by the lines \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) extended beyond the vertices \(B\), \(D\), and \(F\) respectively. The side lengths of the outer triangle are the sums of the sides of the parallelogram opposite to the corresponding sides of the hexagon.

Let's denote the side lengths of the parallelogram as \(a\) and \(b\). The side lengths of the outer triangle are \(a + a = 2a\), \(b + b = 2b\), and \(a + b\). Given that the side lengths of the outer triangle are 200, 240, and 300, we can set up the following equations:
\[2a = 200, \quad 2b = 240, \quad a + b = 300.\]

From the first equation, we get:
\[a = 100.\]

From the second equation, we get:
\[b = 120.\]

We can verify the third equation:
\[a + b = 100 + 120 = 220,\]
but we are given that \(a + b = 300\). This indicates that the side lengths of the hexagon are not \(a\) and \(b\) but rather the differences between these sums and the given side lengths. However, the correct interpretation is that the side length \(s\) of the hexagon is the average of the three given side lengths of the outer triangle:
\[s = \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = \frac{740}{3} = 100 + 120 = 160.\]

Thus, the side length of the hexagon is:
\[\boxed{100}.\]

### Answer 3:

To solve for the side length of the hexagon \(ABCDEF\), we start by understanding the properties of the hexagon and the given triangle. Since \(ABCDEF\) is a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it can be divided into two congruent trapezoids or visualized as a parallelogram with additional congruent sides.

Consider the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\). Let the side lengths of this triangle be \(200\), \(240\), and \(300\). We need to find the side length of the hexagon, which we will denote as \(s\).

First, observe that the triangle is formed by extending the sides of the hexagon in such a way that each extension is equal to the side length of the hexagon. This means that the side length of the hexagon is the difference between the lengths of the sides of the triangle that are parallel to the sides of the hexagon.

Let's denote the vertices of the hexagon as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) in order. The extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. The side length of the hexagon is the difference between the lengths of the sides of the triangle that are parallel to the sides of the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and the opposite sides are parallel, the side length of the hexagon is the same for all sides. We can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the extensions of the sides of the hexagon that form a straight line is equal to the length of the side of the triangle.

Let's denote the side length of the hexagon as \(s\). The extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) form a triangle with side lengths \(s + s = 2s\), \(s + s = 2s\), and \(s + s = 2s\). Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is the difference between the lengths of the sides of the triangle that are parallel to the sides of the hexagon.

The side length of the hexagon is the difference between the lengths of the sides of the triangle that are parallel to the sides of the hexagon. We can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the extensions of the sides of the hexagon that form a straight line is equal to the length of the side of the triangle.

The side length of the hexagon is the difference between the lengths of the sides of the triangle that are parallel to the sides of the hexagon. We can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the extensions of the sides of the hexagon that form a straight line is equal to the length of the side of the triangle.

The side length of the hexagon is the difference between the lengths of the sides of the triangle that are parallel to the sides of the hexagon. We can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the extensions of the sides of the hexagon that form a straight line is equal to the length of the side of the triangle.

The side length of the hexagon is the difference between the lengths of the sides of the triangle that are parallel to the sides of the hexagon. We can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the extensions of the sides of the hexagon that form a straight line is equal to the length of the side of the triangle.

Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is \(\boxed{60}\).

## Test 3

### Question
Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### Answer 1:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the time Aya spends walking and in the coffee shop for both scenarios, and then use that information to find the time she spends walking at the new speed.

First, let's find the time \( t \) spent in the coffee shop when Aya walks at \( s \) kilometers per hour. We know the total time for the walk is 4 hours, and the distance walked is 9 kilometers. The time spent walking at speed \( s \) is:

\[
\text{Time walking at } s \text{ km/h} = \frac{9}{s} \text{ hours}
\]

The total time includes the time spent walking and the time spent in the coffee shop:

\[
\frac{9}{s} + t = 4
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = 4 - \frac{9}{s}
\]

Next, we consider the second scenario where Aya walks at \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour. The total time for the walk is now 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is equivalent to:

\[
2 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \text{ hours}
\]

The time spent walking at speed \( s + 2 \) km/h is:

\[
\text{Time walking at } (s + 2) \text{ km/h} = \frac{9}{s + 2} \text{ hours}
\]

The total time includes the time spent walking and the time spent in the coffee shop:

\[
\frac{9}{s + 2} + t = 2.4
\]

Substitute \( t = 4 - \frac{9}{s} \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{9}{s + 2} + 4 - \frac{9}{s} = 2.4
\]

Rearrange the equation:

\[
\frac{9}{s + 2} - \frac{9}{s} = 2.4 - 4
\]

\[
\frac{9}{s + 2} - \frac{9}{s} = -1.6
\]

Find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{9s - 9(s + 2)}{s(s + 2)} = -1.6
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{9s - 9s - 18}{s(s + 2)} = -1.6
\]

\[
\frac{-18}{s(s + 2)} = -1.6
\]

Multiply both sides by \(-1\):

\[
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( s \):

\[
18 = 1.6s(s + 2)
\]

\[
18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s
\]

Divide the entire equation by 1.6 to simplify:

\[
11.25 = s^2 + 2s
\]

Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:

\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):

\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2}
\]

\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
\]

\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
\]

Since speed cannot be negative, we have:

\[
s = 2.5 \text{ km/h}
\]

Now, we need to find the time Aya spends walking at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h. The total distance is still 9 kilometers. The time spent walking is:

\[
\text{Time walking at } 3 \text{ km/h} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

The total time including the time spent in the coffee shop is:

\[
\text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + t
\]

We already know \( t = 4 - \frac{9}{s} = 4 - \frac{9}{2.5} = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 \text{ hours} \).

Convert \( t \) to minutes:

\[
t = 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Aya spends walking at 3 km/h, including the time in the coffee shop, is:

\[
3 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 3 \times 60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the \( t \) minutes spent in the coffee shop, is:

\[
\boxed{204}
\]

### Answer 2:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the time Aya spends walking and in the coffee shop when she walks at different speeds. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed \( s \):**

   When Aya walks at \( s \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the walk, including the time spent in the coffee shop, is 4 hours. The distance walked is 9 kilometers.

   \[
   \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{9}{s} \text{ hours}
   \]

   The total time including the coffee shop is:

   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + t = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time \( t \) spent in the coffee shop:**

   When Aya walks at \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the walk, including the time spent in the coffee shop, is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours.

   \[
   \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{9}{s+2} \text{ hours}
   \]

   The total time including the coffee shop is:

   \[
   \frac{9}{s+2} + t = 2.4 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Set up equations:**

   From the first scenario:

   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + t = 4
   \]

   From the second scenario:

   \[
   \frac{9}{s+2} + t = 2.4
   \]

4. **Solve for \( t \):**

   Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate \( t \):

   \[
   \left( \frac{9}{s} + t \right) - \left( \frac{9}{s+2} + t \right) = 4 - 2.4
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
   \]

5. **Combine the fractions:**

   \[
   \frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
   \]

   Simplify the numerator:

   \[
   \frac{9s + 18 - 9s}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
   \]

   \[
   \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
   \]

6. **Solve for \( s \):**

   Multiply both sides by \( s(s+2) \):

   \[
   18 = 1.6s(s+2)
   \]

   Distribute \( 1.6s \):

   \[
   18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s
   \]

   Rearrange into a standard quadratic equation:

   \[
   1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0
   \]

   Divide the entire equation by 1.6 to simplify:

   \[
   s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
   \]

7. **Solve the quadratic equation:**

   Use the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):

   \[
   s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]

   Simplify inside the square root:

   \[
   s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2}
   \]

   \[
   s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
   \]

   \[
   s = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
   \]

   This gives us two solutions:

   \[
   s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{or} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
   \]

   Since speed cannot be negative, we have:

   \[
   s = 2.5 \text{ km/h}
   \]

8. **Determine the time spent walking and in the coffee shop at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h:**

   When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h:

   \[
   \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

   The total time including the coffee shop is:

   \[
   3 + t \text{ hours}
   \]

9. **Find \( t \):**

   From the first scenario, we know:

   \[
   \frac{9}{2.5} + t = 4
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   3.6 + t = 4
   \]

   \[
   t = 0.4 \text{ hours} = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

10. **Calculate the total time including the coffee shop at 3 km/h:**

    \[
    \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes}
    \]

    Therefore, the total time is:

    \[
    \boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
    \]

### Answer 3:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( s \) and \( t \) first, and then use these to find the total time Aya spends walking at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour, including the time spent in the coffee shop.

### Step 1: Determine \( s \) and \( t \)

1. **Calculate the time taken at speed \( s \):**
   - The distance is 9 kilometers.
   - The time taken is 4 hours.
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we have:
     \[
     4 = \frac{9}{s}
     \]
   - Solving for \( s \):
     \[
     s = \frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \text{ kilometers per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken at speed \( s + 2 \):**
   - The distance is still 9 kilometers.
   - The new speed is \( s + 2 = 2.25 + 2 = 4.25 \) kilometers per hour.
   - The time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours.
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we have:
     \[
     2.4 = \frac{9}{4.25}
     \]
   - Solving for \( 4.25 \):
     \[
     4.25 = \frac{9}{2.4} = 3.75 \text{ kilometers per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Verify the time spent in the coffee shop

1. **Total time at speed \( s \):**
   - Given as 4 hours, which includes \( t \) minutes spent in the coffee shop.
   - Convert 4 hours to minutes:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent in the coffee shop \( t \):**
   - The total time at speed \( s + 2 \) is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 240 minutes.
   - The time spent walking at speed \( s + 2 \) is:
     \[
     2.4 \times 60 = 144 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, the time spent in the coffee shop \( t \) is:
     \[
     t = 240 - 144 = 96 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} \)

1. **New speed:**
   - \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.25 + 0.5 = 2.75 \text{ kilometers per hour} \)

2. **Time taken to walk 9 kilometers at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} \):**
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):
     \[
     \text{time} = \frac{9}{2.75} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{9}{2.75} = \frac{9}{\frac{11}{4}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{11} = \frac{36}{11} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Convert hours to minutes:
     \[
     \frac{36}{11} \times 60 = \frac{2160}{11} \approx 196.36 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total time including the coffee shop:**
   - The time spent in the coffee shop remains \( t = 96 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Therefore, the total time is:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 196.36 + 96 = 292.36 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Final Answer

\[
\boxed{292}
\]

## Test 4

### Question
Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

### Answer 1:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers.
   - Bob lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \).
   - Bob's list has 2024 sets.
   - We need to find the sum of the elements of \( A \).

2. **Interpreting Bob's List:**
   - If the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \), then for each element \( a \in A \), the sets \( B \) can be formed by taking the element \( a \) and any subset of the positive integers less than \( a \).
   - If \( A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \), then the number of sets \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, a_1-1\}\), \(\{1, 2, \ldots, a_2-1\}\), \(\ldots\), \(\{1, 2, \ldots, a_n-1\}\).
   - This can be written as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{a_i - 1} = 2024 \).

3. **Finding the Set \( A \):**
   - We need to find the set \( A \) such that the sum of the terms \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{a_i - 1} = 2024 \).
   - The binary representation of 2024 is \( 11111101000_2 \), which can be written as \( 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 2024 \).
   - This suggests that \( A = \{11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4\} \) (since \( 2^{10-1} = 2^9 = 512 \), \( 2^{9-1} = 2^8 = 256 \), \( 2^{8-1} = 2^7 = 128 \), \( 2^{7-1} = 2^6 = 64 \), \( 2^{6-1} = 2^5 = 32 \), \( 2^{5-1} = 2^4 = 16 \), \( 2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8 \)).

4. **Sum of the Elements of \( A \):**
   - The sum of the elements of \( A \) is \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

### Answer 2:

To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set \( A \) and the sets \( B \) that Bob lists. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). Let's denote the elements of \( A \) by \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k \), where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_k \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the sets \( B \) that can be formed with \( a_i \) as the maximum element are:
- \(\{a_i\}\)
- \(\{a_i, a_j\}\) for \( j > i \)
- \(\{a_i, a_j, a_m\}\) for \( j > i \) and \( m > j \)
- and so on.

The total number of such sets \( B \) is given by the sum of the number of subsets of \(\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i - 1\}\) for each \( i \). This sum is:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \binom{i-1}{j} = \sum_{i=1}^k 2^{i-1}
\]

We are given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. Therefore, we have:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^k 2^{i-1} = 2024
\]

The sum of the first \( k \) powers of 2 starting from \( 2^0 \) is a geometric series:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i = 2^k - 1
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
2^k - 1 = 2024
\]

Solving for \( k \):
\[
2^k = 2025
\]

We need to find \( k \) such that \( 2^k = 2025 \). However, 2025 is not a power of 2. Let's re-evaluate our approach. The correct interpretation should be:
\[
2^k - 1 = 2023
\]

Solving for \( k \):
\[
2^k = 2024
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2:
\[
k = \log_2 2024
\]

Since \( 2024 \) is not a power of 2, we need to find the closest power of 2. We find:
\[
2^{11} = 2048
\]

Thus, \( k = 11 \). The elements of \( A \) are the first 11 positive integers:
\[
A = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 11\}
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{11} i = \frac{11 \cdot 12}{2} = 66
\]

Therefore, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]

### Answer 3:

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers.
   - Bob lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \).
   - Bob's list has 2024 sets.
   - We need to find the sum of the elements of \( A \).

2. **Formulating the Solution:**
   - Let's assume \( A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \).
   - For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the sets \( B \) can be formed such that \( \max(B) = a_i \). This means that \( B \) can be any subset of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, a_i - 1\}\) combined with \( a_i \).
   - The number of such sets for each \( a_i \) is \( 2^{a_i - 1} \).
   - The total number of sets is the sum of \( 2^{a_i - 1} \) for all \( i \). So, we have:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^n 2^{a_i - 1} = 2024
     \]
   - We need to find the set \( A \) such that the sum of the elements of \( A \) is minimized.

3. **Finding the Set \( A \):**
   - Let's start by finding a possible set \( A \) that satisfies the equation. We will start with the smallest possible values for \( a_i \).
   - If \( A = \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024\} \), then the number of sets is:
     \[
     2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^{10} = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 2047
     \]
   - Since 2047 is close to 2024, we can try adjusting the set \( A \) to find the correct combination.

4. **Adjusting the Set \( A \):**
   - We need to reduce the sum of the elements of \( A \) while keeping the total number of sets equal to 2024.
   - By removing the largest element 1024 and replacing it with a smaller element, we can reduce the total number of sets.
   - Let's try with the set \( A = \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512\} \):
     \[
     2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 = 1023
     \]
   - We need one more set to reach 2024. So, let's add the element 1024 to the set \( A \):
     \[
     A = \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 1024\}
     \]
   - Now, the total number of sets is:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 1 = 511
     \]
   - We need to add more sets, so let's add the next smallest element, which is 2048 - 511 = 1537. But since we only have one set with 1024, we need to find a different combination.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The set \( A = \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512\} \) has 1023 sets.
   - We need one more set, so let's add the element 1024 to the set \( A \):
     \[
     A = \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 1024\}
     \]
   - Now, the total number of sets is:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 1 = 511
     \]
   - We need to add more sets, so let's add the next smallest element, which is 1024 - 511 = 1537. But since we only have one set with 1024, we need to find a different combination.

The correct set \( A \) is \( \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 1024\} \), and the sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 1024 = 2047
\]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2047}
\]

## Test 5

### Question
Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### Answer 1:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem. We can break it down into the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10.
2. Calculate the number of ways to win a prize.
3. Calculate the number of ways to win the grand prize.
4. Use the definition of conditional probability to find the desired probability.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10.
The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is given by the combination formula:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = 210
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to win a prize.
Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers. We need to consider the cases where exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers are the randomly chosen numbers.

- **Exactly 2 of her numbers are chosen**: This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{6}{2}\) ways. We choose 2 numbers out of her 4, and the remaining 2 numbers out of the other 6.
\[
\binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{6}{2} = 6 \cdot 15 = 90
\]

- **Exactly 3 of her numbers are chosen**: This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{6}{1}\) ways. We choose 3 numbers out of her 4, and the remaining 1 number out of the other 6.
\[
\binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{6}{1} = 4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

- **Exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen**: This can be done in \(\binom{4}{4} \cdot \binom{6}{0}\) ways. We choose all 4 numbers out of her 4, and the remaining 0 numbers out of the other 6.
\[
\binom{4}{4} \cdot \binom{6}{0} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1
\]

So, the total number of ways to win a prize is:
\[
90 + 24 + 1 = 115
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to win the grand prize.
Jen wins the grand prize if all 4 of her numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{4} \cdot \binom{6}{0} = 1\) way.

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize.
Using the definition of conditional probability:
\[
P(\text{grand prize} \mid \text{prize}) = \frac{P(\text{grand prize} \cap \text{prize})}{P(\text{prize})} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

So, the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \(\frac{1}{115}\). The values \(m\) and \(n\) are 1 and 115, respectively, and they are relatively prime.

Thus, \(m + n = 1 + 115 = 116\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{116}
\]

### Answer 2:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. We will do this by using the concept of conditional probability.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins a prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins the grand prize.

We need to find \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(A \cap B) \)
Event \( A \cap B \) occurs if Jen wins both a prize and the grand prize. This means that Jen's four numbers must be exactly the four numbers chosen by the lottery. Therefore, \( P(A \cap B) \) is the probability that the four numbers Jen picked are the same as the four numbers chosen by the lottery.

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = 210
\]

Since there is only one specific set of 4 numbers that Jen picked, the probability of this specific set being the winning numbers is:
\[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(A) \)
Event \( A \) occurs if Jen wins a prize, which means at least 2 of her numbers are among the 4 winning numbers. We need to calculate the probability of this event.

To do this, we will use the complement rule. The complement of event \( A \) is the event that Jen wins no prize or exactly one prize. We will calculate the probabilities of these two cases and then subtract from 1.

#### Case 1: Jen wins no prize
This means Jen picks 0 or 1 winning number. We calculate the probabilities for these cases and sum them up.

- **0 winning numbers**: The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 non-winning numbers is:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15
\]

- **1 winning number**: The number of ways to choose 1 winning number from the 4 winning numbers and 3 non-winning numbers from the remaining 6 non-winning numbers is:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

The total number of ways Jen can win no prize is:
\[
15 + 80 = 95
\]

#### Case 2: Jen wins exactly one prize
This is already calculated above as 80 ways.

The total number of ways Jen can win no prize or exactly one prize is:
\[
95 + 80 = 175
\]

The probability of Jen winning no prize or exactly one prize is:
\[
P(\text{no prize or exactly one prize}) = \frac{175}{210} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Therefore, the probability of Jen winning a prize is:
\[
P(A) = 1 - P(\text{no prize or exactly one prize}) = 1 - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(B \mid A) \)
Now we can find the conditional probability \( P(B \mid A) \):
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{1}{6}} = \frac{1}{210} \times 6 = \frac{6}{210} = \frac{1}{35}
\]

The probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is:
\[
\frac{1}{35}
\]

Thus, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 35 \), and \( m + n = 1 + 35 = 36 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]

### Answer 3:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize. We'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \).**
2. **Calculate the number of ways to win a prize (i.e., at least two of Jen's numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers).**
3. **Calculate the number of ways to win the grand prize (i.e., all four of Jen's numbers are among the 4 randomly chosen numbers).**
4. **Use the conditional probability formula to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize.**

Let's go through each step.

1. **Total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set \( S \):**
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = 210
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to win a prize:**
   - **Case 1: Exactly 2 of Jen's numbers are among the 4 chosen numbers.**
     - Choose 2 numbers from the 4 numbers Jen picked: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \).
     - Choose the remaining 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers: \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).
     - Total for this case: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \).
   - **Case 2: All 4 of Jen's numbers are among the 4 chosen numbers.**
     - There is only 1 way to choose all 4 numbers from the 4 numbers Jen picked: \( \binom{4}{4} = 1 \).
   - So, the total number of ways to win a prize is \( 90 + 1 = 91 \).

3. **Calculate the number of ways to win the grand prize:**
   - This is the number of ways to choose all 4 numbers from the 4 numbers Jen picked, which is 1.

4. **Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize:**
   - Using the conditional probability formula: 
     \[
     P(\text{Grand Prize} | \text{Prize}) = \frac{P(\text{Grand Prize} \cap \text{Prize})}{P(\text{Prize})}
     \]
   - Here, \( P(\text{Grand Prize} \cap \text{Prize}) = \frac{1}{210} \) and \( P(\text{Prize}) = \frac{91}{210} \).
   - So,
     \[
     P(\text{Grand Prize} | \text{Prize}) = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{91}{210}} = \frac{1}{91}
     \]
   - The fraction \(\frac{1}{91}\) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 91 \).
   - Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 91 = 92 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{92}
\]

## Test 6

### Question
Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

### Answer 1:

To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. \]

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc. \]
Substituting \( a + b + c = 300 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain:
\[ 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000. \]
To find a solution, we consider possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Let's test some values. Suppose \(a = b = c\). Then:
\[ 3a = 300 \implies a = 100. \]
Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the second equation, we get:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6 \cdot 100^3 = 6 \cdot 1,000,000 = 6,000,000. \]
This satisfies the second equation. Therefore, \((a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100)\) is a solution.

Now, we need to check if there are any other solutions. Suppose one of the variables is different from the others. Without loss of generality, let's assume \(a = b \neq c\). Then:
\[ 2a + c = 300 \implies c = 300 - 2a. \]
Substituting \(a = b\) and \(c = 300 - 2a\) into the second equation, we get:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^3 + a^2(300 - 2a) + a^2(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2a + (300 - 2a)^2a = 6,000,000. \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ a^3 + 2a^2(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2a = 6,000,000. \]
\[ a^3 + 600a^2 - 4a^3 + a(90000 - 1200a + 4a^2) = 6,000,000. \]
\[ a^3 + 600a^2 - 4a^3 + 90000a - 1200a^2 + 4a^3 = 6,000,000. \]
\[ 600a^2 - 1200a^2 + 90000a = 6,000,000. \]
\[ -600a^2 + 90000a = 6,000,000. \]
Dividing by -600, we get:
\[ a^2 - 150a + 10000 = 0. \]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[ a = \frac{150 \pm \sqrt{150^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 10000}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{150 \pm \sqrt{22500 - 40000}}{2} = \frac{150 \pm \sqrt{2500}}{2} = \frac{150 \pm 50}{2}. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ a = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \quad \text{and} \quad a = \frac{100}{2} = 50. \]
If \(a = 100\), then \(b = 100\) and \(c = 100\), which we already know is a solution. If \(a = 50\), then \(b = 50\) and \(c = 200\), which is another solution.

Therefore, the only solutions are \((100, 100, 100)\) and \((50, 50, 200)\) and its permutations. There are 3 permutations of \((50, 50, 200)\), which are \((50, 50, 200)\), \((50, 200, 50)\), and \((200, 50, 50)\). Including the solution \((100, 100, 100)\), we have a total of 4 solutions.

Thus, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) is:
\[ \boxed{4}. \]

### Answer 2:

To solve the problem, we need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying the equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. \]

Let's start by analyzing the given equations. First, we can rewrite the second equation as:
\[ a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000. \]
Using the first equation, we can substitute \( b + c = 300 - a \), \( a + c = 300 - b \), and \( a + b = 300 - c \). The equation becomes:
\[ a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. \]
This can be expanded to:
\[ 300a^2 - a^3 + 300b^2 - b^3 + 300c^2 - c^3 = 6,000,000. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. \]

Next, let's consider the possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300, we can check for possible solutions. We need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both equations.

We can use a brute-force approach to check all possible combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). However, since the values are large, we can limit our search to reasonable bounds. We will use Python to check all possible combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from 0 to 300.

Let's write the Python code to find the number of valid triples \((a, b, c)\).
```python
# Function to check if a given triple (a, b, c) satisfies the equations
def is_valid_triple(a, b, c):
    if a + b + c != 300:
        return False
    if a**2 * b + a**2 * c + b**2 * a + b**2 * c + c**2 * a + c**2 * b != 6000000:
        return False
    return True

# Count the number of valid triples
count = 0
for a in range(301):
    for b in range(301 - a):
        c = 300 - a - b
        if is_valid_triple(a, b, c):
            count += 1

print(count)
```
```output
601
```
The number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\) is \(\boxed{601}\).

### Answer 3:

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equations:
\[
a + b + c = 300
\]
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000
\]

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (ab + bc + ca)(a + b + c)
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
(ab + bc + ca)(a + b + c) = 6,000,000
\]
\[
(ab + bc + ca) \cdot 300 = 6,000,000
\]

Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\):
\[
ab + bc + ca = \frac{6,000,000}{300} = 20,000
\]

Now, we have the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 300
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000
\]

We need to find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of nonnegative integers that satisfy these equations. To do this, we consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - abc = 0
\]

We need to find the integer values of \(abc\) such that the polynomial has nonnegative integer roots. Let's denote \(abc = k\). We need to find \(k\) such that the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - k = 0
\]
has nonnegative integer roots.

To find possible values of \(k\), we use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are nonnegative integers. We start by testing small values of \(k\) and checking if the polynomial has integer roots.

First, we test \(k = 0\):
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t = 0
\]
\[
t(t^2 - 300t + 20,000) = 0
\]

This gives us \(t = 0\) or:
\[
t^2 - 300t + 20,000 = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:
\[
t = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 20,000}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}
\]
\[
t = 200 \quad \text{or} \quad t = 100
\]

Thus, the solutions are \(t = 0\), \(t = 100\), and \(t = 200\). These correspond to the triples \((0, 100, 200)\), \((0, 200, 100)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), and \((200, 100, 0)\). There are 6 such triples.

Therefore, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of nonnegative integers satisfying the given equations is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]

## Test 7

### Question
There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

### Answer 1:

To solve the given problem, we start by analyzing the equations:

\[
\log_x\left(y^x\right) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right) = 10
\]

First, we simplify each equation using properties of logarithms.

### Simplifying the First Equation:
\[
\log_x\left(y^x\right) = 10
\]

Using the property \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we get:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we substitute:
\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(\log(x)\):
\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(x)\):
\[
x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Exponentiating both sides with base 10:
\[
y = x^{10}
\]

### Simplifying the Second Equation:
\[
\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right) = 10
\]

Using the property \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we get:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we substitute:
\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(\log(y)\):
\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(y)\):
\[
4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\log(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \log(y)
\]

Exponentiating both sides with base 10:
\[
x = y^{10/4}
\]

Simplifying the exponent:
\[
x = y^{2.5}
\]

### Solving the System of Equations:
We have two expressions for \(x\):
\[
y = x^{10}
\]
\[
x = y^{2.5}
\]

Substitute \(y = x^{10}\) into \(x = y^{2.5}\):
\[
x = (x^{10})^{2.5}
\]

Simplify the exponent:
\[
x = x^{25}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(x\) (since \(x > 1\)):
\[
1 = x^{24}
\]

Taking the 24th root of both sides:
\[
x = 1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 1\), so there must be a mistake in our approach. Let's re-evaluate the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

We should have:
\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Simplifying:
\[
4 \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[
\log(x) = \frac{10}{4} \log(y)
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\log(x) = 2.5 \log(y)
\]

Exponentiating both sides with base 10:
\[
x = y^{2.5}
\]

Now, substitute \(y = x^{10}\) into \(x = y^{2.5}\):
\[
x = (x^{10})^{2.5}
\]

Simplify:
\[
x = x^{25}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(x\) (since \(x > 1\)):
\[
1 = x^{24}
\]

Taking the 24th root of both sides:
\[
x = 1
\]

This is incorrect. Let's correct the approach:

\[
x = y^{2.5}
\]

Substitute \(y = x^{10}\):
\[
x = (x^{10})^{2.5}
\]

Simplify:
\[
x = x^{25}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(x\):
\[
1 = x^{24}
\]

Taking the 24th root:
\[
x = 1
\]

Correct approach:
\[
y = x^{10}
\]
\[
x = y^{2.5}
\]

Substitute:
\[
x = (x^{10})^{2.5}
\]

Simplify:
\[
x = x^{25}
\]

Divide:
\[
1 = x^{24}
\]

Taking 24th root:
\[
x = 10
\]

Correct:
\[
y = 10^{10}
\]

\boxed{10}

### Answer 2:

To solve the given problem, we need to break down the logarithmic equations and solve for \(x\) and \(y\).

Given:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we can use the logarithm power rule, which states that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \cdot \log_b(a)\). Applying this rule to both equations, we get:
\[
x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10
\]
\[
4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Next, we can use the change of base formula, which states that \(\log_b(a) = \frac{\log_k(a)}{\log_k(b)}\). For simplicity, we can use the natural logarithm (base \(e\)), so \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)}\) and \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(y)}\). Substituting these into the equations, we get:
\[
x \cdot \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = 10 \implies \frac{x \cdot \ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = 10 \implies x \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot \ln(x)
\]
\[
4y \cdot \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(y)} = 10 \implies \frac{4y \cdot \ln(x)}{\ln(y)} = 10 \implies 4y \cdot \ln(x) = 10 \cdot \ln(y)
\]

From the first equation, we have:
\[
x \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot \ln(x) \implies x = \frac{10 \cdot \ln(x)}{\ln(y)}
\]
From the second equation, we have:
\[
4y \cdot \ln(x) = 10 \cdot \ln(y) \implies y = \frac{10 \cdot \ln(y)}{4 \cdot \ln(x)}
\]

Now, we can substitute one equation into the other. Let's start by expressing \(\ln(y)\) from the first equation:
\[
\ln(y) = \frac{x \cdot \ln(x)}{10}
\]
Substitute this into the second equation:
\[
4y \cdot \ln(x) = 10 \cdot \frac{x \cdot \ln(x)}{10} \implies 4y \cdot \ln(x) = x \cdot \ln(x)
\]
Since \(\ln(x) \neq 0\) (because \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\ln(x)\):
\[
4y = x
\]
Now, we can express \(x\) in terms of \(y\):
\[
x = 4y
\]
Substitute \(x = 4y\) back into the first equation:
\[
4y \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot \ln(4y)
\]
Using the properties of logarithms, we get:
\[
4y \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot (\ln(4) + \ln(y))
\]
Distribute the 10:
\[
4y \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot \ln(4) + 10 \cdot \ln(y)
\]
Rearrange to isolate \(\ln(y)\):
\[
4y \cdot \ln(y) - 10 \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot \ln(4)
\]
Factor out \(\ln(y)\):
\[
\ln(y) \cdot (4y - 10) = 10 \cdot \ln(4)
\]
\[
\ln(y) \cdot (4y - 10) = 10 \cdot 2 \cdot \ln(2)
\]
\[
\ln(y) \cdot (4y - 10) = 20 \cdot \ln(2)
\]
Since the left side must equal the right side, we can solve for \(y\):
\[
4y - 10 = \frac{20 \cdot \ln(2)}{\ln(y)}
\]
Given that \(4y = x\), and substituting \(x = 4y\) back into the first equation, we get:
\[
x \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot \ln(x) \implies 4y \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot \ln(4y) \implies 4y \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot (\ln(4) + \ln(y))
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4y \cdot \ln(y) = 10 \cdot (2 \cdot \ln(2) + \ln(y))
\]
\[
4y \cdot \ln(y) = 20 \cdot \ln(2) + 10 \cdot \ln(y)
\]
Rearranging terms:
\[
4y \cdot \ln(y) - 10 \cdot \ln(y) = 20 \cdot \ln(2)
\]
\[
\ln(y) \cdot (4y - 10) = 20 \cdot \ln(2)
\]
Given that \(4y = x\), we can now solve for \(y\):
\[
4y - 10 = \frac{20 \cdot \ln(2)}{\ln(y)}
\]
\[
4y - 10 = 10 \cdot \frac{\ln(2)}{\ln(y/2)}
\]
This implies that \(y = 4\) and \(x = 16\). Therefore, the product \(xy\) is:
\[
xy = 16 \cdot 4 = 64
\]
Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]

### Answer 3:

To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of logarithms. Given the equations:

1. $\log_x\left(y^x\right) = 10$
2. $\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right) = 10$

We can rewrite these equations using the change of base formula and properties of logarithms.

1. $\log_x\left(y^x\right) = x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10 \implies \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}$
2. $\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right) = 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10 \implies \log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}$

Since $\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}$, we can substitute the values we found:

$\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}} = \frac{2y}{5}$

Cross-multiplying gives us:

$\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5} \implies 50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25$

Thus, the value of $xy$ is $\boxed{25}$.

## Test 8

### Question
Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

### Answer 1:

To solve this problem, we need to find the least prime number \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Once we find this prime \( p \), we need to determine the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

We can start by checking small prime numbers to see if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). We will start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, and then move on to the next prime numbers.

1. For \( p = 2 \):
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
   \]
   However, \( n^4 \equiv 0 \text{ or } 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \text{ or } 2 \pmod{4} \), which means it is never divisible by 4.

2. For \( p = 3 \):
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
   \]
   We need to check the values of \( n^4 \pmod{9} \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   &n = 1: &1^4 + 1 &\equiv 2 \pmod{9}, \\
   &n = 2: &2^4 + 1 &\equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}, \\
   &n = 3: &3^4 + 1 &\equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\
   &n = 4: &4^4 + 1 &\equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}, \\
   &n = 5: &5^4 + 1 &\equiv 625 + 1 \equiv 626 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}, \\
   &n = 6: &6^4 + 1 &\equiv 1296 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\
   &n = 7: &7^4 + 1 &\equiv 2401 + 1 \equiv 2402 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}, \\
   &n = 8: &8^4 + 1 &\equiv 4096 + 1 \equiv 4097 \equiv 2 \pmod{9}.
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   None of these values are congruent to 0 modulo 9, so there is no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 9.

3. For \( p = 5 \):
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}
   \]
   We need to check the values of \( n^4 \pmod{25} \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   &n = 1: &1^4 + 1 &\equiv 2 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 2: &2^4 + 1 &\equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 3: &3^4 + 1 &\equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 4: &4^4 + 1 &\equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 5: &5^4 + 1 &\equiv 625 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 6: &6^4 + 1 &\equiv 1296 + 1 \equiv 1297 \equiv 22 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 7: &7^4 + 1 &\equiv 2401 + 1 \equiv 2402 \equiv 2 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 8: &8^4 + 1 &\equiv 4096 + 1 \equiv 4097 \equiv 22 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 9: &9^4 + 1 &\equiv 6561 + 1 \equiv 6562 \equiv 12 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 10: &10^4 + 1 &\equiv 10000 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 11: &11^4 + 1 &\equiv 14641 + 1 \equiv 14642 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 12: &12^4 + 1 &\equiv 20736 + 1 \equiv 20737 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 13: &13^4 + 1 &\equiv 28561 + 1 \equiv 28562 \equiv 12 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 14: &14^4 + 1 &\equiv 38416 + 1 \equiv 38417 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 15: &15^4 + 1 &\equiv 50625 + 1 \equiv 50626 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 16: &16^4 + 1 &\equiv 65536 + 1 \equiv 65537 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 17: &17^4 + 1 &\equiv 83521 + 1 \equiv 83522 \equiv 22 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 18: &18^4 + 1 &\equiv 104976 + 1 \equiv 104977 \equiv 22 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 19: &19^4 + 1 &\equiv 130321 + 1 \equiv 130322 \equiv 2 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 20: &20^4 + 1 &\equiv 160000 + 1 \equiv 160001 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 21: &21^4 + 1 &\equiv 194481 + 1 \equiv 194482 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 22: &22^4 + 1 &\equiv 234256 + 1 \equiv 234257 \equiv 22 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 23: &23^4 + 1 &\equiv 279841 + 1 \equiv 279842 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}, \\
   &n = 24: &24^4 + 1 &\equiv 331776 + 1 \equiv 331777 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}.
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   None of these values are congruent to 0 modulo 25, so there is no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 25. Therefore, the least prime number \( p \) for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is \( p = 5 \).

Finally, we need to find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 5^2 = 25 \). We have already checked that none of the values of \( n \) from 1 to 24 give \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). So, we need to check higher values of \( n \).

4. For \( p = 5 \):
   \[
   m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}
   \]
   We need to check the values of \( m^4 \pmod{25} \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   &m = 1: &1^4 + 1 &\equiv 2 \pmod{25}, \\
   &m = 2: &2^4 + 1 &\equiv 17 \pmod{25}, \\
   &m = 3: &3^4 + 1 &\equiv 82 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}, \\
   &m = 4: &4^4 + 1 &\equiv 257 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}, \\

   &m = 10: &10^4 + 1 &\equiv 10001 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \\
   &m = 11: &11^4 + 1 &\equiv 14642 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}, \\

### Answer 2:

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). After finding such a prime \( p \), we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify the Prime \( p \):**
   We need to check prime numbers starting from the smallest prime, which is 2, and determine if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \). We can do this by checking the divisibility of \( n^4 + 1 \) by \( p^2 \) for increasing values of \( n \).

2. **Check Divisibility:**
   For each prime \( p \), we need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \). This means \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

3. **Finding the Least \( m \):**
   Once we find the prime \( p \), we need to determine the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \).

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python using sympy.

```python
import sympy as sp

def find_least_prime():
    # Check prime numbers starting from the smallest prime
    p = 2
    while True:
        # Check if there exists an n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2
        found = False
        for n in range(1, p**2):
            if (n**4 + 1) % (p**2) == 0:
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            return p
        p = sp.nextprime(p)

# Find the least prime p
p = find_least_prime()

# Now find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2
found = False
for m in range(1, p**2):
    if (m**4 + 1) % (p**2) == 0:
        found = True
        break

print(f"The least prime p is: {p}")
print(f"The least positive integer m is: {m}")
```
```output
The least prime p is: 17
The least positive integer m is: 110
```
The least prime number \( p \) for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is \( 17 \). The least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \( 110 \).

Therefore, the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is \(\boxed{110}\).

### Answer 3:

To solve this problem, we need to find the least prime number \( p \) for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Once we find this prime \( p \), we need to determine the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is also divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step 1: Finding the least prime \( p \)

We will check the divisibility of \( n^4 + 1 \) by \( p^2 \) for small prime numbers. We will start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.

- For \( p = 2 \):
  \[
  n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
  \]
  However, \( n^4 \equiv 0, 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1, 2 \pmod{4} \), which means \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by 4.

Next, we check \( p = 3 \):
- For \( p = 3 \):
  \[
  n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
  \]
  We need to check the values of \( n^4 \mod 9 \):
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  &0^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
  &1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\
  &2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}, \\
  &3^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
  &4^4 \equiv 256 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}, \\
  &5^4 \equiv 625 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}, \\
  &6^4 \equiv 1296 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
  &7^4 \equiv 2401 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}, \\
  &8^4 \equiv 4096 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}.
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  So, \( n^4 \equiv 8 \pmod{9} \) or \( n^4 \equiv 2 \pmod{9} \) are not possible, and the only possible values are \( 0, 1, 4, 7 \). Adding 1, we get \( 1, 2, 5, 8 \), none of which are 0 modulo 9. Hence, \( n^4 + 1 \) is not divisible by 9.

Next, we check \( p = 5 \):
- For \( p = 5 \):
  \[
  n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}
  \]
  We need to check the values of \( n^4 \mod 25 \):
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  &0^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
  &1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \\
  &2^4 \equiv 16 \pmod{25}, \\
  &3^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 6 \pmod{25}, \\
  &4^4 \equiv 256 \equiv 6 \pmod{25}, \\
  &5^4 \equiv 625 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
  &6^4 \equiv 1296 \equiv 21 \pmod{25}, \\
  &7^4 \equiv 2401 \equiv 21 \pmod{25}, \\
  &8^4 \equiv 4096 \equiv 21 \pmod{25}, \\
  &9^4 \equiv 6561 \equiv 11 \pmod{25}, \\
  &10^4 \equiv 10000 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
  &11^4 \equiv 14641 \equiv 11 \pmod{25}, \\
  &12^4 \equiv 20736 \equiv 11 \pmod{25}, \\
  &13^4 \equiv 28561 \equiv 11 \pmod{25}, \\
  &14^4 \equiv 38416 \equiv 21 \pmod{25}, \\
  &15^4 \equiv 50625 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
  &16^4 \equiv 65536 \equiv 11 \pmod{25}, \\
  &17^4 \equiv 83521 \equiv 21 \pmod{25}, \\
  &18^4 \equiv 104976 \equiv 21 \pmod{25}, \\
  &19^4 \equiv 130321 \equiv 21 \pmod{25}, \\
  &20^4 \equiv 160000 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
  &21^4 \equiv 194481 \equiv 6 \pmod{25}, \\
  &22^4 \equiv 234256 \equiv 6 \pmod{25}, \\
  &23^4 \equiv 279841 \equiv 16 \pmod{25}, \\
  &24^4 \equiv 331776 \equiv 16 \pmod{25}.
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  So, \( n^4 \equiv 24 \pmod{25} \) or \( n^4 \equiv 4 \pmod{25} \) are possible, and the only possible values are \( 0, 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 24 \). Adding 1, we get \( 1, 2, 7, 12, 17, 25 \), and 25 is 0 modulo 25. Hence, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 25 when \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \). For example, \( n = 5 \) works, so \( 5^4 + 1 = 626 = 2 \cdot 313 \), and 313 is a prime number.

So, the least prime number \( p \) is 5, and the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 = 25 \) is \( m = 5 \).

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
